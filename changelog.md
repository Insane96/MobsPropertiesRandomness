# Changelog

## Alpha 4.1.0
* Updated to MC 1.19.2, requires InsaneLib 1.7.5+
* Changed `mob_id` and `entity_tag` to `target`
  * Target accepts either a mob like `mob_id` would or an entity tag with a # before the name. E.g. to target all skeletons you can do "#minecraft:skeletons"

### Notes
This is marked as Alpha because World Whitelist is currently not implemented yet.  
Also marked as an alpha because stuff might be broken as I didn't fully test it.  
Tinkers Construct is not yet implemented as ... well, there's no 1.19.2 version of TiCon yet
